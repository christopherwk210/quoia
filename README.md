<p align="center">A no-dependencies build system for static websites.</p>

## Intro
Quoia is a framework/build system written in Node for generating static websites. It has **zero dependencies** and is built to be flexible. It borrows a few ideas from modern front-end frameworks, but generates a completely static site ready to be served, without the need for extra external dependencies being loaded. It's goal is to provide a way for website developers to leverage a re-usable component system, scoped styles, and templating engines in an environment that doesn't require a front-end framework.
